  <h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (Upon Study Completion)</h2>

  <p><strong>Linwood Institute Announces Successful Conclusion of RMI Program – “Cohort 3”</strong></p>

  <p>Linwood Institute is proud to acknowledge the anticipated closure of its Recall Modulation Initiative (RMI), following the projected success of its third and final human trial cohort.
  Over five years of research, the RMI program has explored safe, stable methods of memory modulation and identity isolation, with the goal of improving long-term resilience in trauma-affected populations.</p>

  <p>Cohort 3, the final B-series trial group, has demonstrated what internal review boards are calling a “landmark response” in structured memory reprogramming—showing measurable reductions in associative overload, affective instability, and identity collapse.
  Data from this cohort has already laid the foundation for next-generation neuromnemonic protocols.</p>

  <p>Pending publication, the Linwood Institute is authorized to disclose the following individuals as members of the B-series RMI Cohort 3 group:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Subject B-01 – Michael Brown</li>
    <li>Subject B-02 – Raymond Burynski</li>
    <li>Subject B-03 – Andrew Benson</li>
    <li>Subject B-04 – Oscar Pratt</li>
    <li>Subject B-05 – Nate Bennett</li>
    <li>Subject B-06 – Matthew Cioni</li>
    <li>Subject B-07 – Matthew Abraham</li>
    <li>Subject B-08 – Liam Evans</li>
    <li>Subject B-09 – Thomas Torchia</li>
    <li>Subject B-10 – Joseph Molanare</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Institute extends its gratitude to all participants, staff, and advisory partners whose efforts have shaped the future of cognitive therapeutics. A formal briefing for press and academic publication will be made available upon final audit.</p>
