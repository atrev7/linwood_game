NOTE - PERSONAL LOG EXCERPT

Amanda always brings the same tea to our calibration reviews-some citrus blend I can't place. She never drinks it. Just holds it while she talks.

She keeps her notes on actual paper, too. Folds them in quarters, writes on both sides, margins included. I asked her once if she preferred analog because of security concerns. She said no-it just feels real that way.

She notices when the systems lag by a half-second. When the interface jumps or the vault echo flickers out of sync. She doesn't say anything immediately, just tilts her head, waits, then looks at me.

I've come to rely on that look.

She's careful with people. Not warm, exactly, but precise. It's a different kind of care. You can tell she still believes this place could be better than it is.

I don't know if that makes her na√Øve or brave. Probably both.

One of the best I have.
