    <h3>Dr. Leo Linwood</h3>
    <p><strong>Director of Experimental Neurocognitive Systems</strong></p>
    <p>Applied Recall Research & RMI Engineering</p>
    <p><em>11 years</em></p>
    <div class="toggle-btn">More Info</div>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>Dr. Linwood is the founding architect behind the Linwood Institute’s RMI (Recall Modulation Index) platform, and has led the Institute’s cognitive systems division since its inception. His research focuses on memory isolation, identity fragmentation, and triggered recall—fields in which he is internationally regarded as a leader. A triple doctorate holder (Neurobiology – Johns Hopkins, Applied Psychology – Stanford, Cognitive Systems Engineering – MIT), Leo has served as a guest lecturer or research fellow at institutions including ETH Zurich, Karolinska Institute, and Caltech. His work appears in over two dozen peer-reviewed journals and several classified consortium reports. Often described by colleagues as intense, driven, and “selectively transparent,” Linwood has filed 15 active patents and personally oversaw the development of the Institute’s cognitive vault protocols—systems that some now describe as too effective.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Leo once attempted to automate Linwood’s internal audit process using only biometric triggers. It did not go well.</p>

    <h3>Dr. Amanda Reynolds</h3>
    <p><strong>Senior Cognitive Researcher</strong></p>
    <p>Neurological Conditioning & Memory Retrieval</p>
    <p><em>6 years</em></p>
    <div class="toggle-btn">More Info</div>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>Dr. Reynolds specializes in the neurobiological mechanics of memory suppression and long-term identity modulation. Her work has been foundational in designing Linwood’s RMI (Recall Modulation Index) architecture, particularly in vault stabilization and stimulus-triggered memory recall. A former faculty member at Vanderbilt, Amanda has presented internationally on ethical barriers in neuro-algorithmic conditioning and is widely recognized as one of the few researchers at Linwood to openly question trial pacing. Outside of work, Amanda contributes to Linwood’s internal ethics council and runs a wellness group for remote staff.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> She insists her Labrador retriever, Marco, is “the cutest employee on payroll.” No one has argued.</p>

    <div class="bio">
      <p>Dr. Shin oversees Linwood’s Child Systems Division, where her team studies early neuroplasticity, memory formation patterns, and pre-verbal recall architecture. Her research has been used to refine ethical baselines in experimental vault conditioning, ensuring protective thresholds are respected during high-sensitivity tests. While not directly affiliated with the RMI trials, Shin’s “ARC-17” study on generational imprinting and learning response models laid early groundwork for much of Linwood’s internal ethics scaffolding. A graduate of the prestigious Harvard Medical School, she’s widely respected across both clinical and academic circles for her advocacy of subject-based review standards and her emphasis on consent modeling.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Still uses her old research passphrase “echo twins” as a joke when mentoring new hires—though no one remembers where the phrase came from.</p>

    <div class="toggle-btn">More Info</div>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>Dr. Park specializes in predictive behavioral analysis, building long-range outcome models that help Linwood forecast the ripple effects of experimental protocols. Though not directly involved with RMI, his team's simulations influenced many of the institute's policy restrictions and fail-safe designs. Edwin is often consulted during ethics reviews and systems audits, particularly when uncertainty metrics cross a threshold. He earned his doctorate in Computational Neuroscience from the University of Chicago, where he also lectured on risk modeling and decision theory before joining Linwood. He rarely speaks during cross-divisional meetings but is known to submit post-meeting memos so precise they feel algorithmically generated.</p>
