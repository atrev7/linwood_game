Leo,

I've reviewed the B-series logs again. There are emerging patterns - loop decay, behavior bleed, recall pingbacks. We need to hit pause.

These are real people. If B-01 is activating without prompt, we've already lost containment.

We said suppression was a failsafe. It's starting to look like trauma.

Amanda,

We also said memory was a liability. You saw what happened to A-series.

This isn't about individual discomfort. It's about protection - from relapse, from collapse, from themselves.

The vaults hold. That's the point.

B-06 flagged twice during synthetic dream trial #12.
B-03 re-pulsed their loop pattern at 04:41 AM despite suppression protocol.

You keep saying 'they're safer forgetting.'
What if they're not?

Then we tighten the recall gate. You've seen the framework - there's room to isolate dream feedback from surface ping.

We do not stop because one subject decided to bleed.

You keep citing control, but we were never supposed to erase them.
We said we'd protect memory, not bury it.

Somewhere along the way, the vault became the goal - not the safeguard.

I don't think I can keep calling this a study.
