Still hearing the ping before shutdown. Three loops ago it came earlier. Maybe it's learning? Maybe I'm imprinting it the wrong way.

Amanda said something about 'grief weight' today. That memories have mass. I laughed. She didn't. I think she meant it.

Phase B validation metrics are flattening. Recall density is unpredictable. The vaults are stuttering. I told them it was environmental interference. It's not.

What did I eat yesterday? Did I eat yesterday?

I remember when we thought the vault would be quiet. I told Dr. Shin it would feel like sleep. It doesn't. It loops. It reflects. It remembers too much.

They keep asking why Amanda stormed out today. The file says PTO. The hallway says argument. The truth's in between.

Prototype crashed again. Salvageable data = maybe 8%. Still better than nothing. Still not enough.

Subject B-01 pinged the net. Just once. Long enough to break silence. Never thought it would hurt so much to see an old friend.

Loop calibration ran clean. 10 subjects. 10 different recoveries. None aligned with baseline. We don't recover memory. We rebirth it I guess.

Working with Reynolds is great. All the bickering of a wife, none of the rewards.

My hands were shaking in the meeting. Not from fear. From caffeine. Maybe fear too.

Dr. Shin requested cohort review logs for B-series. Said she needed to track 'loop trauma signatures.' I told her we don't officially recognize that term. She didn't care.

Amanda left Marco in the lab overnight. Again. Marco didn't bark-just stared at the wall. Loop artifact? Environmental mirroring? Or maybe dogs just get tired too.

First night in the server room. Slept there. Woke up thinking I was someone else. Good sign or a warning?

What if the vault doesn't protect them from memory?
What if it protects the memory from them?

Backup array failed checksum. Repaired and repeated. Second run passed. Don't trust either.

I wrote a message. To her. Didn't send it. She deserves to hear it-but not like this. I failed them.

Jordan thinks we are a brand. We are a Research Institute. No, I will not tik tok dance.

We give them clarity. We give them peace. We give them permission to forget. And we buried the receipt.
