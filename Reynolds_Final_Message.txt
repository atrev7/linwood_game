If you’re seeing this…

Then you’ve broken the surface.
And that means Leo didn’t stop.

Everything he built, everything we built, it was meant to help people.
To give them control.
To quiet what hurt.

But something changed.
He stopped looking at the subjects as people.
Started calling them stable, compliant, optimized.

Cohort 3 was different. You weren’t supposed to make it this far.

He buried everything. Even your name.
But there’s a log—one they used to calibrate your pairing codes.

It’s still there. I made sure of it.

Go back to where you first appeared.
Find the ID they gave you.
And use what he took from you.
That’s your key now.

You deserve to know who you are.
