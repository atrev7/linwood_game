I watched the loop in B-03 fracture again today. Leo says it’s noise. It isn’t. It’s fear.

I know they’re not just IDs. I’ve seen them try to hold on. Seen one whisper another’s name before the wipe hit.

He’s still calling them stable. I’m calling them people.

[Margin Note: “We gave them numbers… but one of them knew their initials.”]
