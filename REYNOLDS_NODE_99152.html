[Soft click. Line connects. Distant static. A low hum. Then Amanda’s voice—measured, tired, emotionally restrained.]

“If you’re hearing this, It's Amanda. The Institute’s routing hasn’t wiped my backup nodes.”

“I don’t know who you are—or what state you’re in—but if you found this, then Leo went through with it.”

“There’s no override now. That was the point.”


“I’ve been trying to piece together what we did. Not what the models say—we know what those say. I mean what actually happened to them… to you.”

“Kathy tried to warn us. She said pairing recall was unstable, that the feedback loop was too fragile.”  
[Soft scoff.]  

“She even gave it some… ridiculous nickname. Like she was trying to make it sound less terrifying.”

[A faint shuffle—papers.]

“Anyway… I left a file. I hid it where I thought I’d go if I were trying to remember something I’d buried.”

“If you’ve found this, you’ll need that phrase. The one she used.”

[Pause. Almost a whisper.]  
“Leo wasn’t wrong about everything. Just the part where he thought you’d be safer forgetting.”

[Click. Beeping. Silence]
