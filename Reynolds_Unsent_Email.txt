Unsent Message - To L. Linwood

Leo,

I drafted four different versions of this. None of them felt honest, so here's the one that does:

You were right. I believed in the core premise. I still do.
But this isn't it anymore.

The A-series taught us fear. The B-series is teaching us something worse-how to justify what we've done.

You keep calling this restoration. I've started calling it reprogramming.
We're not giving them their memories back. We're giving them our version of their memories.

You asked if I could live with this. I'm trying.
