Subject: I'm sorry

Cynthia,

I should have written sooner. I've started this message more times than I can count.

I keep telling myself it was for the right reasons. That he wanted peace. That he needed a way through the noise. That this was a way out of the static.

But today I saw the signal. And I knew.

I took something that wasn't mine to take. Not data. Not consent. Something quieter, harder to name. Maybe it was time. Maybe it was weight. Maybe it was the right to carry his past in his own way.

What we did wasn't supposed to hurt anyone. It was supposed to hold the pain still. I thought I could hold it for him.

I was wrong.

I don't expect forgiveness. I only wanted you to hear this from me, before it spreads through other channels. If anything reaches you-documents, notices, stories-know that none of it reflects what he gave, or who he is.

Mike was my friend. Still is. I failed him.
