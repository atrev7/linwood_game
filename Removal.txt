LINWOOD INSTITUTE – INTERNAL MEMORANDUM
Subject: Request for Role Reassignment
From: Amanda Reynolds, Ph.D.
Division: RMI Research Oversight
Date: April 9, 2024
To: Ethics & Personnel Operations

To whom it may concern,

This memo serves as a formal request for reassignment out of the RMI division,
effective immediately upon departmental approval.

While I remain committed to Linwood's broader mission, I no longer believe my
continued involvement with Recall Management Infrastructure, specifically Vault
Policy 17.3, aligns with my professional or ethical responsibilities. I have
expressed concerns internally regarding trial oversight, emergent subject response
patterns, and long-term psychological impacts that I believe require independent
review.

I respectfully request that my project directories, including personal logs and
internal notes, be cleared from active access and archived in accordance with
retention protocols. I am also requesting exemption from further participation in
B-series data reviews or subject loop casework.

Please direct all communications to my primary institutional channel until
reassignment is confirmed.

- Amanda Reynolds, Ph.D.
Research Oversight – RMI Division
