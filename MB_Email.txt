Subject: You ever still hear it?

Mike,

You ever still hear it? The thing you don't talk about but shows up anyway-in the quiet moments, or just as you're about to sleep?

I've been working on something. It's still scaffolding-barely that-but if we're right about where memory can be housed, we might be able to change how it returns. Or keep some of it from returning at all.

We're not funded. We're not approved. We're not even sure it's ethical in its final form.

But if it works... it could let you breathe again.

Just talk to me. You'd be early, but not alone.

-Leo

Leo,

You always did know how to phrase a question like it was a diagnosis.

I'm listening. Bring your scaffolding.
